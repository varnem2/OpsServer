## Install into environment
cd into ether the MPMissions or missions folder. This folder is located in ~/Documents/Arma 3 - Other Profiles/{Your Profile Name}/missions or mpmissions
Install git.
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME" //I just use varnem2 or Dash.B
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com" //You'll find this email in https://github.com/settings/emails look under the section of Primary email address you'll see a huge long email with lots of numbers. Use that one.

git init //sets up the folder for github
git remote add origin https://github.com/varnem2/OpsServer.git //tells github where the remote repo is
git pull //refreshes the local repo to include the contents of the remote repo
git checkout master //checkouts the correct branch this can be set to any branch off the main repo


## Making an update

`git checkout -b <new branch name> ` //use this to make a new branch off the main code. Use a descriptive name so we know the purpose of the branch.

Often you will use underscores or cammel case to separate out words.
`
    Ex: 
        Update_ReadMe_With_Branching
        updateReadMeWithBranching
`

Make your changes however you see fit locally. Once finished or you wish to share your branch, you may do some of the following commands.

`git add . `//this adds all the files both in the folder you're in and all the subfolders you are in.

` git commit -m "<you're message>"` //use this to add a message with your commit. The code get's complicated.. Add the message please.

` git push origin <branch name>` //This will send all changes to the remote repo.

## Once you're ready to submit your changes to the main branch again follow these instructions.
